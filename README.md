**Museum Scope:**
| Code | Museum |
| --- | --- |
| ACM | Asian Civilisations Museum |
| NMS | National Museum of Singapore |
| TPM | The Peranakan Museum |
| IHC | Indian Heritage Centre |

Both the historical window for training and the forecast horizon are configurable (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

## Data Source

### SingStat TableBuilder API
| Series | Table ID | Used as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly museum visitorship | `M891071` | forecast target (`value`) |
| Total international visitor arrivals | `M550001` | exogenous feature (`intl_arrivals`) |

Both series are fetched at runtime by `src/data/singstat_api.py`.

The requested window is set by `START_YEAR`/`START_MONTH` and `END_YEAR`/`END_MONTH` in `config.py` (currently Jan 2014 – Mar 2026, monthly). Raw responses are written to `data/raw/museum_ts.csv` and `data/raw/intl_arrivals.csv` for reference.
